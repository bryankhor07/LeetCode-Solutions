# Time complexity: O(nlogn + qlogn), where n is the length of the input list nums, and q is the number of queries.
# The time complexity is dominated by the sorting operation on nums and the binary search for each query.   
# Space complexity: O(n), where n is the length of the input list nums. The space is used to store the prefix sums array.
