# Time Complexity: O(n log n), where n is the length of the input list skill. The time complexity is due to the sorting of the input list.
# Space Complexity: O(n). The space complexity is due to the hashmap, which stores the sum of the skill levels as keys and the product of the skill levels as values. The size of the hashmap is at most n/2, where n is the length of the input list skill.
